	<p>Hey there! I'm Trevor - I'm a first year economist and Jardine Scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge. This website is a collection of my ramblings on economics and various other things, with a focus on macroeconomics. I post around once a fortnight and you can keep up with my posts by <a href="https://buttondown.email/tmychow">subscribing to my newsletter</a>.</p>
