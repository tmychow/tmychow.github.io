	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>Hey there! I'm Trevor - I'm a first year economist and Jardine Scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge. This website is a collection of my ramblings on economics and various other things, with a focus on macroeconomics. I post around once a fortnight and you can keep up with my posts by <a href="https://buttondown.email/tmychow">subscribing to my newsletter</a>.</p>
	<p> My 5 most recent posts are below, with the full blog archive available <a href="https://tmychow.com/blog/">here</a>. Some of my posts you may want to check out include: <a href="https://tmychow.com/blog/2020/05/14/a-conversation-with-nobel-laureate-oliver-hart">my interview with Nobel Laureate Oliver Hart</a>, <a href="https://tmychow.com/blog/2020/07/02/growth-a-primer-in-three-parts">my three-part primer on economic growth</a>, <a href="https://tmychow.com/blog/2020/12/19/mr-medlock-and-the-classics">my summary of social democratic economic policy</a> and <a href="https://tmychow.com/blog/2021/01/24/comings-and-goings">my review of the open borders literature</a>.</p>
	<p>I'm always interested in opportunities to get involved with economic research, policy thinktanks, and policymaking - my resume is readily available <a href="/assets/Resume.pdf">here</a>. Beyond that, I love hearing what people think about my blog and to connect with/learn from those with overlapping interests - as such, don't hesitate to get in touch by <a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow">twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:tmychow@gmail.com?subject=Mostly Economic Musings">email</a>. I am busy at times, but I'll always make sure to respond in some way!</p>
