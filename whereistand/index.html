	<a name="micro"><p><strong>Microeconomics - What is it about?</strong></p></a>
	<p> The foundational question of microeconomics is: "how should we allocate scarce resources to meeting competing ends?" Given the billions of goods and services and billions of people, this is a difficult question to answer. Suppose we have a consumer - when they consume, they get satisfaction. We will call the satisfaction of consuming one extra unit of something its marginal utility. Suppose we have a firm - when it produces, it costs them resources (land, labour, capital and enterprise). We will call the cost of producing one extra unit of something its marginal cost. One way to think about our foundational question is allocative efficiency. That is where the following holds. \[ \frac{MU1}{MC1} = \frac{MU2}{MC2} \] Consider what happens if \( \frac{MU1}{MC1}>\frac{MU1}{MC1} \)? That means the "bang per buck" of producing the next unit of good 1 is greater than of good 2 - in that case, society should be making more of good 1 until these two equalise. In the real world, we have hundreds of thousands of \( \frac{MU}{MC} \) ratios - how could we possibly equalise all of those? And how do we even know what the marginal utility and marginal cost of a good is to every single person? This feels like an intractable problem. </p>

	<p><strong>Microeconomics - How do markets work?</strong></p>
	<p> Let's introduce prices - that is, consumers pay prices for things. In that case, consumers will allocate their spending in the following way. \[  \frac{MU1}{P1} = \frac{MU2}{P2} \] The reasoning for this is similar to how we get the condition for allocative efficiency. Consider what happens when they aren't equal - consumers will reallocate their spending until they are equal. And they are able to do this because we assume that goods provide a diminishing marginal utility as you get more of it. Producers will be producing in the following way. \[ P = MC \] If $P > MC$, producers would keep producing more of that good, since selling it would be profitable. And they will make enough of it until the two equalise, which occurs because the marginal cost of producing stuff increases. Consider if I am a farmer - I'll start with my most fertile piece of land and use the next most fertile piece and so on - and so as I produce more, I'm getting less out of the land. </p>
	<p> In both of these cases, neither consumers nor producers needed to worry about the other side - they just needed to compare their own utility or costs to the price. And we can combine the equations we have so far in the following way. \[ \frac{MU1}{P1} = \frac{MU2}{P2} \] \[ P1 = MC1 \] \[ P2 = MC2 \] \[ \frac{MU1}{MC1} = \frac{MU2}{MC2} \] And we get the condition for allocative efficiency. That's the thing - prices are signals that allow people to coordinate in an allocatively efficient way, without needing to know all the information. </p>

	<p><strong>Microeconomics - How do markets fail?</strong></p>
	<p> We have seen the utopia of free market magic. But what happens when there's a monopoly for good 1? Because no one forces them to drive down the price due to their market power, they can set \( P1>MC1 \). If we combine the equations as we did before, we get a problematic outcome. \[ P1 > MC1 \] \[ P2 = MC2 \] \[ \frac{MU1}{P1} = \frac{MU2}{P2} \] \[ \frac{MU1}{MC1} > \frac{MU2}{MC2} \] The monopoly has distorted the market, increasing the price of a good such that we produce too little of it. We can see it is too little, because the "bang per buck" for good 1 is greater than for good 2. </p>
	<p> Now let's consider what happens when producing a good causes spillover benefits or costs onto third parties, who are not involve in the transaction. For example, the coal power plant emits some air pollution. This means that our efficiency condition should look at the marginal social utility and marginal social cost - that is, considering both the private benefits and costs, as well as the spillovers. \[ \frac{MSU1}{MSC1}=\frac{MSU2}{MSC2} \] Suppose good 1 generates a negative externality, which is not reflected in the price. We can do the same analysis as before. \[ P1 < MSC1 \] \[ P2 = MSC2 \] \[ \frac{MU1}{P1} = \frac{MU2}{P2} \] \[ \frac{MU1}{MSC1} < \frac{MU2}{MSC2} \] Because the price signal does not incorporate the external spillovers i.e. all the costs of producing the good, we end up producing too much of good 1. </p>
	<p> Let's introduce two terms - non-rival and non-excludable. Non-rival means that my consumption of the good doesn't diminish your consumption of the same good. Non-excludable means that it is not possible to stop someone from using the good. We can look at the 4 categories of goods and services based on these two criteria. </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Rival and excludable: markets are good at producing these goods. These are most goods we usually think about.
		<li> Rival but non-excludable: the tragedy of the commons, where markets tend to over-consume these goods. Consider why over-fishing occurs.
		<li> Non-rival but excludable: markets tend to under-provide these goods. Think of research and development, where me using an idea doesn't stop you, but where I can lock you out with patents or JSTOR paywalls.
		<li> Non-rival and non-excludable: these are public goods, which markets are bad at providing due to the free rider problem. The military is an example of a public good - once it exists, it is hard to exclude someone in your country from its protection.
	</ul>
	<p> One assumption we have made is that people have perfect information. In practice, consumers may have imperfect information about the costs and benefits of a good. This can lead to them misjudging the marginal utility. By contrast, asymmetric information is where one party has information the other doesn't. This can create moral hazard, where someone has the ability and incentive to shift the costs onto someone else. For example, if you have fire insurance, you are less likely to buy a fire extinguisher, because the costs are passed onto the insurance company. This is a problem, because the total societal cost is raised. Asymmetric information can also create a principal-agent problem. That is where the principal is unable to fully monitor the behaviour of the agent, who they have tasked with doing something. For example, it is difficult for someone to know if all the prescriptions a doctor recommends is correct and necessary, while they may have the incentive to tell you that you need more than you do, in order to increase their billables. Finally, information asymmetry can lead to adverse selection. Consider a market of used cars, where half are "peaches" that are good, and half are "lemons' which are bad. If you are a buyer, you are unable to tell which is which - and so you are only willing to pay the average of how much you value peaches and lemons. That causes the sellers of peaches to leave the market - and so you are left with a missing market.  </p>

	<p><strong>Microeconomics - How do governments work?</strong></p>
	<p> Governments can help correct for market failures. If there is a monopoly, they can regulate it away via anti-trust laws. xternalities could be dealt with by government taxation. Imagine a tax such that \( (1+t)P=MSC \) - this forces people to bear the external costs, making the price signal an accurate reflection of the social costs. Another mechanism is by regulating the quantity of production - the most obvious is carbon cap-and-trade systems. The question of which to use depends on whether it is easier to estimate the optimal price or optimal quantity. Governments can help provide public goods. They can also help regulate the commons - for example, one of the ways to reduce over-hunting is to fence off bits of land and give people permits to hunt on their piece. Because that area is theirs, the government has transformed it from non-excludable to excludable, solving the problem. Finally, informational problems may simply require informational solutions. Governments can help educate the public or make informational access easier. </p>

	<p><strong>Microeconomics - How do governments fail?</strong></p>
	<p> We've seen how governments can help correct market failures - but they can themselves create government failures, if they step in when there isn't something to be fixed. Consider what happens to our original allocative efficiency conditions if they impose a tax. This will distort the price signal. A price ceiling, price floor or quota will also disrupt the allocative mechanism. This is not to mention the fact that governments are not omniscient beings, and so they could themselves make mistakes. And there is a danger of regulatory capture, where regulators become co-opted to serve a specific constituency. Therefore a useful three-step process is to think: 1. What is the market failure? 2. Is the intervention likely to fix the market failure, or will it simply create a government failure? 3. Is the market failure so bad you need the government to step in for direct provision? </p>
	
	<a name="macromodels"><p><strong>Macroeconomics - A Mental Model</strong></p></a>
	<p> In order to think about the macroeconomy, we need a framework for how we model it. We can look at macroeconomics as the study of three overlapping areas - the equilibrium real world, the equilibrium normal world and the disequilibrium sticky world. The equilibrium real world is looking at changes in our economy that are not dependent on stickiness or monetary factors - that is, we are investigating long-run growth across a few decades. The equilibrium normal world is focused on the medium run of a around a decade, where prices adjust completely - in other words, we are looking at the effect of money without stickiness. And the disequilibrium sticky world is the short run business cycle dynamics of up to a few years - here, we emphasise the transitory interactions between the real and the nominal. </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Long-Run Growth</strong></p>
	<p> The neoclassical model of the long run is the basic Solow model of \( Y_t = K^{\frac{1}{3}}_t L^{\frac{2}{3}}_t \). This relates output to the inputs of capital and labour. Labour is constant at \( L_t = L_0 \), while capital starts at \( \bar{K}_0 \) at time \( t=0 \) but changes at \( \Delta K_{t+1} = \bar{s}Y_t - \delta K_t \). We can easily demonstrate that there will be a steady-state level of output \( Y^* \) to which the model converges. Although this is a useful description of the data as Mankiw, Romer, and Weil argue in "A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth" (1992), Easterly and Levine note in "It's Not Factor Accumulation" (2000) that factor accumulation cannot drive long-run economic growth. Instead, we need some form of endogenous growth - the simplest way to get that, as per Jones in "Growth: With or Without Scale Effects?" (1995), is by including the creation of ideas in order to get increasing returns to scale. We can create a Solow-Romer model of \( Y_t = A_t K^{\frac{1}{3}}_t L^{\frac{2}{3}}_t \), where labour being divided between producing output \( L_{yt} \) or producing research \( L_{at} \) in the ratio \( \bar{L} \bar{\ell} = L \). This produces a change in TFP of \( \Delta A_{t+1} = \bar{z} A_t L_{at} \), allowing for a balanced growth path in the long run with the Solow transition dynamics. </p> 
	<p> All of this suggests that a good medium-run strategy is to increase your capital stock, educate your workforce, urbanise and open up to international trade. And a useful long-run strategy is to increase total factor productivity by improving technology and resource utilisation, by finding more cost-effective methods of production and introducing new goods. Our model means that although convergence doesn't occur, conditional convergence does - this is confirmed by Barro and Sala-i-Martin in "Convergence" (1991), as well as Barro and Sala-i-Martin in "Convergence across States and Regions" (1991).  </p>


	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Medium-Run Money and Prices </strong></p>
	<p> Let's now look at the monetary world. Because the nominal value of money is constant, its real value is equal to the reciprocal of the price level \( \frac{1}{P} \). Inflation is the change in the value of money. The value of money is determined by its supply and demand. The demand for money depends on how much cash people want to hold. Although it seems like we determine how much money we carry in our wallets, the central bank determines the average cash holdings of everyone - that is, when the central bank increases the money supply, people will try and get rid of excess cash balances. Individually this is possible, but collectively it isn't. This paradox is resolved by the hot potato effect, where people's attempts to get rid of their cash by spending increases aggregate demand and the price level, such that equilibrium is reached again. And so it is clear that individuals determine their real cash holdings, while the central bank determines the average nominal cash holdings as they adjust the money supply. </p>
	<p> Having established what money is, there are four monetary facts of interest. The neutrality of money says that the level and growth rate of output is independent of the money supply and its growth rate - that is, you cannot print yourself rich. The quantity theory of money says that a change in the money supply will lead to a proportional change in the price level, while a change in the growth rate of money will lead to a proportional change in the inflation rate. These two facts are emphasised by Hume in "Of Money" (1752), by Lucas in "Monetary Neutrality" (1995), as well as McCandless and Weber in "Some Monetary Facts" (1995). The Fisher equation relates the real interest rate, the nominal interest rate and inflation in the form \( r = i - \pi \). This means that a change in inflation will cause an equal change in nominal interest rates, as the real interest rate equals the marginal product of capital in equilibrium \( \bar{r}=MPK \). Finally, Rogoff notes in "The PPP Puzzle" (1996) that exchange rates reflect purchasing power parity. As such, a change in the inflation differential between two countries will cause an equal change in the rate of appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. All of these implicitly rely on something real to hold constant in the medium run, whether that is the real demand for money, the real interest rate or the real exchange rate. </p>


	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Short-Run Business Cycles</strong></p>
	<p> Our third area of enquiry regards short-run dynamics - that means the interaction of the real and nominal. The reason the real and nominal are related in the short run is because money is used as the medium of account by which we measure all other values. Friedman described money as "a veil [hiding the real economy], but when the veil flutters, real output sputters" - that is, our measuring stick of value itself changing in value causes problems. That occurs because prices are sticky, such that a change in the money supply will temporarily affect real variables such as output and employment. This is like a game of musical chairs, where a few participants end up sitting on the floor when the music stops and some chairs are removed - in effect, a recession can occur when a monetary change reduces the nominal income available to support full employment at existing nominal wage levels. </p>
	<p> There are three curves of interest in setting up our short-run model. The first is the long-run aggregate supply curve, representing the growth rate that would exist if prices were perfectly flexible, as given by our Solow-Romer combined model. The second is the aggregate demand curve that describes the combinations of real output level and price level or real output growth and inflation given a certain nominal output level. The third is the short-run aggregate supply curve that describes the combinations of real output level and price level or real output growth and inflation given a certain level of expected inflation. </p>
	<p> We can derive the AD curve in a few ways. The first is by considering the equation of exchange \( M_t V_t = P_t Y_t \), which says that the volume of monetary transactions equals the volume of nominal spending. We can see that for some fixed level of nominal output, there will be a set of possible values for \( P \) and \( Y \). If we take the logarithm of both sides and differentiate with respect to time, we can get a similar relationship between output growth and inflation. </p> 
	<p> The second is based on the traditional IS-LM model. Consider the goods market - the Investment-Savings curve \( Y = g - br \) describes combinations of interest rates associated with output and some fiscal variable. As for the money market, the Liquidity Preference-Money Supply curve \( m - P = Y - hr \) shows how a monetary variable, the price level, output and interest rates keep money supply equalling money demand. Together, they describe the equilibrium level of \( (Y,r) \) given some policy variables \( (g,m) \) and price level \( P \) - we can combine IS-LM into a single equation to solve for \( (Y,P) \) endogenously by eliminating the interest rate. This produces the aggregate demand curve. \[ y = \frac{h}{b+h}g + \frac{b}{b+h} (m-p) \] A modern approach of IS-MP looks at monetary policy with interest rates at the forefront, such that \( r = \frac{1}{h} (P+Y-m) \) - but this is the same as IS-LM substantively, simply configured differently for pedagogical reasons. </p>
	<p> A third way is to derive the AD curve from IS-LM graphically. Take an IS-LM diagram. Keep nominal money constant while increasing the price level. This shifts the LM curve upwards, meaning that a higher price level leads to a lower output. Thus we have the AD curve. </p>
	<img src="/assets/derivedad.png" alt="Deriving AD" width="600"> 
	<p> The fourth and final derivation is based on the modern New-Keynesian IS-MP model. The IS curve relates short-run output growth \( \tilde{Y}_t = \frac{Y_t-\bar{Y}_t}{\bar{Y}_t} \) to a general shock parameter and the difference between real interest rate and natural real interest rate, such that \( \tilde{Y_t} = \bar{a} - \bar{b} (r_t - \bar{r}) \). The MP curve \( r_t - \bar{r} = \bar{m} (\pi_t - \bar{\pi}) \) sets nominal interest rates based on a Taylor Rule, and this affects real interest rates via sticky inflation and the Fisher equation. We can again combine the two to produce an AD curve \( \tilde{Y_t} = \bar{a} - \bar{b} \bar{m} (\pi_t - \bar{\pi}) \) that relates short-run output growth to inflation. </p>
	<p> If we just had the LRAS and AD curves, any changes in AD would not lead to fluctuations in output but simply adjustments in the price level. And so we need the SRAS curve - this describes how a change in AD is split among price and real output. The reason there are effects on real output is because of the stickiness described above, such that the price level does not adjust immediately in the short run. A simple SRAS curve of \( P = w + aY \)  might describe the price level with respect to a rigid nominal wage level and output. A graphical derivation could arise by considering the labour market. If we keep nominal wages constant while increasing the price level, this increases hours worked. We can see that more hours worked increases output in the production function diagram. And so we can combine this to produce the SRAS. </p>
	<img src="/assets/derivedsras.png" alt="Deriving SRAS" width="750">
	<p> Finally, we can take the SRAS curve as an expectations-augmented Phillips Curve \( \pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \bar{v} \tilde{Y_t} + \bar{o} \), which relates inflation to expected inflation (based on adaptive expectations), the output gap and a shock parameter. In all three cases, we get a upwards-sloping SRAS curve. In particular, it is reasonable to believe that the SRAS is flatter when output is below potential output given wages are sticky downwards, and steeper when output is above potential given it cannot infinitely exceed the Solow-Romer growth rate. </p>
	<img src="/assets/model.png" alt="Complete Model" width="400"> 	
	<p> Having established this model of the short run, we can think about its policy implications. Because of the SRAS, AD fluctuations cause changes in real GDP and inflation in the short run. We want to minimise these. We know that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, so monetary policy is tasked with keeping it low and stable. And as Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans note in "Monetary Policy Shocks" (1999), monetary policy can also affect output in the short run. Hence stabilisation policy can helpfully mitigate business cycle fluctuations, as per Friedman in "The Role of Monetary Policy" (1968), Eichenbaum in "Some Thoughts on Practical Stabilization Policy" (1998) or Svensson "What have we learned in the past 50 years" (2008). Because monetary policy faces a time lag in affecting macroeconomic aggregates, central banks target future forecasts by "leaning against the wind" - this is explained by Svensson in "Inflation Forecast Targeting" (1997). </p>
	<p> However, dealing with aggregate supply shocks is more difficult than aggregate demand shocks, because they push inflation ad real GDP growth in different directions. The consequence of real supply shocks isn't just that they cause inflation or output changes - it is that in a sticky world, nominal adjustments do not occur quickly enough such that there is needless cyclical unemployment. Another difficult shock to deal with is credit or financial shocks, because they disrupt the mechanism of monetary policy. </p>
	<p> Monetary policy should be based on systematic and predictable rules, rather than discretionary choices. This is Kydland and Prescott "Rules rather than Discretion" (1977). Macroeconomic policy is affected by expectations, and so statistical correlations may break down if policymakers try to exploit them. This is Lucas "Expectations and the Neutrality of Money" (1972) or Lucas "Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique" (1976). </p>
	<p> If monetary policy is stabilising the business cycle, there is little role for countercyclical fiscal policy. This is Auerbach "Is there a role for discretionary fiscal policy" (2002) or Taylor "Reassessing Discretionary Fiscal Policy" (2000). Fiscal policy should focus on microeconomic issues, such as public goods provision, social insurance provision, reasonably non-distortive taxation, and sensible regulation practices. In other words, government should be an insurance company with an army. If monetary policy is unwilling or unable to do so, activist fiscal policy may be required to rectify fluctuations in aggregate demand. We know empirically that monetary expansion is expansionary and fiscal contraction is contractionary. </p>
	
	<a name="macrohist"><p><strong>Macroeconomics - Its History</strong></p></a>
	<p> Macroeconomics as a discipline was kickstarted by John Maynard Keynes in <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i>, published in 1936. Consider the closed-economy accounting identities of \( Y= C+ I + G \) and \( Y= C+ S + T \) - we can combine this to produce \( S = I + (G - T) \). Now suppose that savings rise with income such that \( S = S(Y) \). That means \( S(Y) = I + (G - T) \), so the adjustment variable if desired savings do not equal desired investment and desired fiscal deficit will be output. It also means that for some full-employment output \( Y^* \), there is a fiscal deficit \( (G-T)^* \) that delivers it. This is <i>The General Theory</i>.</p>
	<p> Until the mid-60s, Old Keynesian macroeconomic research by the likes of John Hicks, Paul Samuelson and Don Patinkin was focused on <i>The General Theory</i>. If we add interest and say that savings and investment depend on the rate of interest, we have \( S(Y,r) = I(r) + (G-T) \) and \( M = L(Y,r) \) for the money market. This allows output and the interest rate to be determined by fiscal policy \( (G-T) \) and monetary policy \( M \). This is "Mr Keynes and the Classics" by Hicks. </p>
	<p> All of this was occurring alongside research into neoclassical growth theory by Robert Solow, Trevor Swan, David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans, which is typified by Solow's 1956 "A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth". Within microeconomic research, Kenneth Arrow, Gérard Debreu and Lionel McKenzie were building up the core of general equilibrium microeconomic theory - this would be best represented by Debreu's <i>A Theory of Value</i> in 1959. These would be put together into the neoclassical synthesis, epitomised by Patinkin's <i>Money, Interest, and Prices</i> in 1965. This synthesis includes prices in our theory, by adding an aggregate supply equation \( P = f(Y) \). This means that the question of policy choice depends on the consumption function \( C(Y,r)= Y - S(Y,r) \), the investment function \( I(r) \), the money demand function \( L(Y,r) \) and the aggregate supply equation \( P = f(Y) \).  </p>
	<p> Alongside this research program, Milton Friedman was contributing to the synthesis via his permanent income hypothesis, while also developing monetarism with scholars such as Karl Brunner, Allan Meltzer and Anna Schwartz - this emphasised the importance of monetary aggregates, the long-run neutrality of money and therefore the transitory and unpredictible effects of fiscal stimulus. This looked at output fluctuations via the equation of exchange \( MV=PY \). The equation says that the volume of monetary transactions equals the volume of nominal spending. If there are fluctuations in money demand, \( V \) will vary. These fluctuations will lead to fluctuations in \( PY \), which affects real income based on the aggregate supply equation \( P=f(Y) \). The way to stabilise for \( Y^*\) given it is a monetary problem is to use a monetary solution of adjusting \( M \). This is the monetarism of Friedman and Schwartz's <i> A Monetary History</i>. Another particular contribution was Friedman's 1967 "The Role of Monetary Policy" address to the American Economics Association, where he dismantled the idea of an invariant Phillips Curve that presented a menu of options to policymakers. Indeed, much of the monetarist critiques would be validated by the inflationary episodes of the 1970s. </p>
	<p> The second wave of dissatisfaction with the mainstream program came from the rational expectations revolution, which had similar doubts about the Phillips Curve as expounded in the Lucas Critique. Focusing on building up macroeconomic models from microeconomic foundations, this was the beginnings of New Classical macroeconomics. Edmund Phelps's <i>Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory</i> in 1970 would act as the inception of this research program. Alongside the likes of Bob Lucas, Robert Barro, Tom Sargent and Fred Mishkin, researchers located mostly around the Great Lakes would conduct the research of this freshwater macroeconomic agenda. They noted that the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on whether it affects the price level or output - and that depends on whether monetary injections are anticipated or not, permanent or not. This means we need to add expectations as \( MV(Y^e,r)=PY \) and \( P=f(Y,P^e) \). Thus money is the short-run adjustment process, while price expectations adjust in the long run. It means that \( Y=Y^* \) when \( P=P^e \). This is typified by the 1972 "Expectations and the Neutrality of Money" from Lucas. Meanwhile, work in the Keynesian tradition progressed alongside in coastal universities, and this was termed saltwater macroeconomics. </p>
	<p> Then came Edward Prescott and Fynn Kydland's "Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations" in 1982. This kicked off real business cycle theory, and the third wave of critiques on Keynesian macroeconomics. Premised on general equilibrium theory and growth theory, this kickstarted the use of new mathematical and methodological tools in macroeconomics. They noted that the other determinant of output is the capital stock and level of total factor productivity, such that \( Y = A F(k) \). As such, fluctuations in \( Y \) and \( Y^* \) can occur due to uneven spurts and jumps in technology. This explanation of business cycles as due to technological shocks allowed for quantitative models of economic fluctuations. Many young scholars like Gary Hansen, John Long and Charles Plosser joined in this approach, culminating in Thomas Cooley's <i>Frontiers of Business Cycle Theory</i> in 1995. </p>
	<p> So what were saltwater economists up to during all of this? They decided to incorporate elements of all of these critiques - they began emphasising the role of monetary policy and inflation expectations as argued for by the monetarists, the microeconomic foundations, intertemporal optimising behaviour and forward-looking agents as posited by the New Classicals, as well as the quantitative modelling, calibration of structural parameters and supply-side focus of the RBCists. But the lack of frictions and rigidities in many of these critiques meant that saltwater macroeconomists decided to adopt all of this while incorporating their own insights on market failures and such. This New Keynesian macroeconomics was spearheaded by economists such as John Taylor, Guillermo Calvo and Julio Rotemberg. Eventually, this would be collated by Greg Mankiw and David Romer in their 1991 <i>New Keynesian Economics</i>. </p>
	<p> By the mid-1990s, we had two capable research teams taking different approaches to the problem of macroeconomics. Two seminal papers to represent this period would be Robert King and Sergio Rebelo's "Resuscitating Real Business Cycles", as well as Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali and Mark Gertler's "The Science of Monetary Policy", both published at the turn of the millennium in 1999. This all came together as the new neoclassical synthesis in Mike Woodford's 2003 <i>Interest and Prices</i>, which took insights from the Keynesian neoclassical synthesis, monetarism, the New Classicals and the RBC theorists. This has a consumption-savings-investment-deficit block, a monetary rule block and an aggregate supply block. \[ Y = f(r,Y^e,G-T) \] \[ r = g(P, P^e, Y-Y^*) \] \[ P = h(P^e, Y-Y^*) \] We have output as well as full-employment output fluctuating. We primarily use monetary policy to close the output gap, and we use policy rules because expectations matter. Researchers such as Lawrence Christiano, Charles Evans, Frank Smets and Raf Wouters have since pioneered further investigation on DSGE models based on this synthesis. And that is the history of macroeconomic thought, taking us from the 1930s all the way to the foundations of the research frontier today. </p>
