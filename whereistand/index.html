	<a name="macro"><p><strong>Macroeconomics - The Timeframes</strong></p></a>
	<p> In the ultra short run of the few months, the main adjustment mechanism is inventories. Prices and capital are fixed. In the short run of up to a few years, the main adjustment mechanism is prices. Capital remains quasi-fixed. In the medium run of around a decade, the main adjustment mechanism is capital. Firms enter and exit at this scale. In the long run, everything has adjusted. There are low-frequency fluctuations due to population growth and technological advances. </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Long-Run Growth</strong></p>
	<p> Economic growth in the long run comes from increase total factor productivity - that is, improvements in technology and resource utilisation. That means a useful long-run strategy is to find more cost-effective methods of production and introduce new goods. This is Easterly and Levine 2000, "It's Not Factor Accumulation" or Jones 1995, "Growth: With or Without Scale Effects?". </p>
	<p> Nonetheless, the basic Solow model where factor accumulation occurs can be a useful core of growth theory. That means a useful medium-run strategy is to increase your capital stock, educate your workforce, urbanise and open up to international trade. This is Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992, "A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth". </p>
	<p> Conditional convergence is the dominant paradigm, although convergence itself isn't. This is Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991, "Convergence" or Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991, "Convergence across States and Regions". </p>


	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Medium-Run Money and Prices </strong></p>
	<p> In the long run, the price level is proportional to the level of the money stock and the inflation rate is proportional to the growth rate of the money stock. This is the quantity theory of money. In the long run, the level and growth rate of output is independent of the money stock and its growth rate. This is the neutrality of money - that is, you cannot print yourself rich. These are Hume 1752, "Of Money" or Lucas 1995, "Monetary Neutrality" or McCandless and Weber 1995 "Some Monetary Facts". </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Short-Run Business Cycles</strong></p>
	<p> In the short run, fluctuations in aggregate demand lead to fluctuations in real GDP and in inflation, due to various market frictions, rigidities and imperfections. We would like to minimise these fluctuations. </p>
	<p> Inflation is a monetary phenomenon, so monetary policy can aim at keeping inflation low and stable. Monetary policy can affect output growth and inflation in the short run via the Phillips Curve relationship. This is Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 1999, "Monetary Policy Shocks". Hence stabilisation policy can usefully mitigate business cycle fluctuations. This is Friedman 1968, "The Role of Monetary Policy" or Eichenbaum 1998, "Some Thoughts on Practical Stabilization Policy" or Svensson 2008, "What have we learned in the past 50 years". </p>
	<p> Monetary policy faces a time lag in affecting macroeconomic aggregates, so central banks should target forecasted future aggregate demand by "leaning against the wind". This is Svensson 1997, "Inflation Forecast Targeting". Dealing with aggregate supply shocks is more difficult than dealing with aggregate demand shocks, because they push inflation and real GDP growth in different directions. Dealing with credit or financial shocks is difficult, because they disrupt the mechanism of monetary policy. </p>
	<p> Monetary policy should be based on systematic and predictable rules, rather than discretionary choices. This is Kydland and Prescott 1977, "Rules rather than Discretion". Macroeconomic policy is affected by expectations, and so statistical correlations may break down if policymakers try to exploit them. This is Lucas 1972, "Expectations and the Neutrality of Money" or Lucas 1976, "Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique". </p>
	<p> If monetary policy is stabilising the business cycle, there is little role for countercyclical fiscal policy. This is Auerbach 2002, "Is there a role for discretionary fiscal policy" or Taylor 2000, "Reassessing Discretionary Fiscal Policy". Fiscal policy should focus on microeconomic issues, such as public goods provision, social insurance provision, reasonably non-distortive taxation, and sensible regulation practices. In other words, government should be an insurance company with an army. If monetary policy is unwilling or unable to do so, activist fiscal policy may be required to rectify fluctuations in aggregate demand. We know that monetary expansion is expansionary and fiscal contraction is contractionary. </p>
	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - International Trade and Finance</strong></p>
	<p> In the long run, exchange rates reflect purchasing power parity. This is Rogoff 1996, "The PPP Puzzle". </p>

	<a name="macromodels"><p><strong>Macroeconomics - Basic IS-LM Modelling</strong></p></a>
	<p> Let's begin with the the specifications of our macroeconomic model. We have output \( y \), price level \( p \), interest rate \( r \), fiscal variable \( g \), monetary variable \( m \), and nominal wage \( w \). The Investment-Savings curve \( y = g - br \) describes the goods market - it shows combinations of interest rates associated with output. The Liquidity Preference-Money Supply curve \( m - p = y - hr \) describes the money market - it shows the combinations of interest rates and real income for which money supply equals money demand. Together, they describe the equilibrium level of \( (y,r) \) given some policy variables \( (g,m) \) and price level \( p \). </p>
	<p> We can move to a system that solves for \( (y,p) \) endogenously. We can combine IS-LM into a single equation to eliminate the interest rate. \[ y = \frac{h}{b+h}g + \frac{b}{b+h} (m-p) \] This is a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve in \( (y,p) \) space, with the slope \( -\frac{b}{b+h} \) and is shifted right by monetary and fiscal policy. </p>
	<p> One modern approach has been to look at the IS-MP model instead of IS-LM. This looks at monetary policy in its modern form, with interest rates at the forefront - it takes the form \( r = \frac{1}{h} (p+y-m) \). But the equation is the same as before, simply configured differently - and so this is a pedagogical rather than substantive distinction. </p>
	<p> We can add an aggregate supply curve, with its slope describing how a change in AD is split among price and output and its intercept being affected by the rigid nominal wage. \[ p = w + ay \] This combination allows us to have a system of equations to understand how changes in policy variables \( (g,m,w) \) affect endogenous variables \( (y,p,r) \). </p>
	
	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Diagrammatic IS-LM Modelling</strong></p>
	<p> We can derive the AD and SRAS curves graphically. Take an IS-LM diagram. Keep nominal money constant while increasing the price level. This shifts the LM curve upwards, meaning that a higher price level leads to a lower output. Thus we have the AD curve. Now take the labour market. Keep nominal wages constant while increasing the price level. This increases hours worked. We can see that more hours worked increases output in the production function diagram. We can combine this to produce the SRAS. </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - New Keynesian AD-AS Modelling</strong></p>
	<p> The New Keynesian world can be represented by a three equation system of IS-MP-PC that becomes an AD-AS model. We have an IS curve relating short-run output to the difference between the real interest rate and the natural interest rate (marginal return on capital)  as well as a shock parameter. We have an MP curve setting the nominal interest rate based on a Taylor Rule, which affects the real interest rate via sticky inflation and the Fisher equation. We have an expectations-augmented Phillips Curve relating inflation to expected inflation (based on adaptive expectations of previous inflation), the output gap and a shock parameter. \[ \tilde{Y_t} = \bar{a} - \bar{b} (R_t - \bar{r}) \] \[ R_t - \bar{r} = \bar{m} (\pi_t - \bar{\pi}) \] \[ \pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \bar{v} \tilde{Y_t} + \bar{o} \] We can combine IS-MP into AD and take PC as AS, to produce a dynamic AD-AS model relating inflation with short-run output, rather than relating the price level to output. \[ \tilde{Y_t} = \bar{a} - \bar{b} \bar{m} (\pi_t - \bar{\pi}) \] </p>
	
	<a name="macrohist"><p><strong>Macroeconomics - Its History</strong></p></a>
	<p> Macroeconomics in its proper was kickstarted by John Maynard Keynes in <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i>, published in 1936. Until the mid-60s, Old Keynesian macroeconomic research by the likes of John Hicks, Paul Samuelson and Don Patinkin was focused on <i>The General Theory</i>. This occurred alongside research into neoclassical growth theory by Robert Solow, Trevor Swan, David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans, which is typified by Solow's 1956 "A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth". Within microeconomic research, Kenneth Arrow, GÃ©rard Debreu and Lionel McKenzie were building up the core of general equilibrium microeconomic theory - this would be best represented by Debreu's <i>A Theory of Value</i> in 1959. These would be put together into the neoclassical synthesis, epitomised by Patinkin's <i>Money, Interest, and Prices</i> in 1965.</p>
	<p> Alongside this research program, Milton Friedman was contributing to the synthesis via his permanent income hypothesis, while also developing monetarism with scholars such as Karl Brunner, Allan Meltzer and Anna Schwartz - this emphasised the importance of monetary aggregates, the long-run neutrality of money and therefore the transitory and unpredictible effects of fiscal stimulus. One particular contribution of this long-run focus was the role of expectations, exemplified in Friedman's 1967 "The Role of Monetary Policy" address to the American Economics Association, where he dismantled the idea of an invariant Phillips Curve that presented a menu of options to policymakers. Indeed, much of the monetarist critiques would be validated by the inflationary episodes of the 1970s. </p>
	<p> The second wave of dissatisfaction with the mainstream program came from the rational expectations revolution, which had similar doubts about the Phillips Curve as expounded in the Lucas Critique. Focusing on building up macroeconomic models from microeconomic foundations, this was the beginnings of New Classical macroeconomics. Edmund Phelps's <i>Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory</i> in 1970 would act as the inception of this research program. Alongside the likes of Bob Lucas, Robert Barro, Tom Sargent and Fred Mishkin, researchers located mostly around the Great Lakes would conduct the research of this freshwater macroeconomic agenda. Work in the Keynesian tradition progressed alongside in coastal universities, and this was termed saltwater macroeconomics. </p>
	<p> Then came Edward Prescott and Fynn Kydland's "Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations". This kicked off real business cycle theory, and the third wave of critiques on Keynesian macroeconomics. Premised on general equilibrium theory and growth theory, this kickstarted the use of new mathematical and methodological tools in macroeconomics. Coupled with their explanation of business cycles as due to technological shocks, this allowed for quantitative models of economic fluctuations. Many young scholars like Gary Hansen, John Long and Charles Plosser joined in this approach, culminating in Thomas Cooley's <i>Frontiers of Business Cycle Theory</i> in 1995. </p>
	<p> So what were saltwater economists up to during all of this? They decided to incorporate elements of all of these critiques - they began emphasising the role of monetary policy and inflation expectations as argued for by the monetarists, the microeconomic foundations, intertemporal optimising behaviour and forward-looking agents as posited by the New Classicals, as well as the quantitative modelling, calibration of structural parameters and supply-side focus of the RBCists. But the lack of frictions and rigidities in many of these critiques meant that saltwater macroeconomists decided to adopt all of this while incorporating their own insights on market failures and such. This New Keynesian macroeconomics was spearheaded by economists such as John Taylor, Guillermo Calvo and Julio Rotemberg. Eventually, this would be collated by Greg Mankiw and David Romer in their 1991 <i>New Keynesian Economics</i>. </p>
	<p> By the mid-1990s, we had two capable research teams taking different approaches to the problem of macroeconomics. Two seminal papers to represent this period would be Robert King and Sergio Rebelo's "Resuscitating Real Business Cycles", as well as Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali and Mark Gertler's "The Science of Monetary Policy", both published at the turn of the millennium in 1999. This all came together as the new neoclassical synthesis in Mike Woodford's 2003 <i>Interest and Prices</i>, with researchers such as Lawrence Christiano, Charles Evans, Frank Smets and Raf Wouters pioneering further investigation on DSGE models based on this synthesis. And that is the history of macroeconomic thought, taking us from the 1930s all the way to the foundations of the research frontier today. </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - History in Equations</strong></p>
	<p> We have the closed-economy accounting identities that \( Y= C+ I + G \) and \( Y= C+ S + T \). We can combine this to produce \( S = I + (G - T) \). Now suppose that savings rise with income such that \( S = S(Y) \). That means \( S(Y) = I + (G - T) \), so the adjustment variable if desired savings do not equal desired investment and desired fiscal deficit will be output. It also means that for some full-employment output \( Y^* \), there is a fiscal deficit \( (G-T)^* \) that delivers it. This is <i>The General Theory</i> from Keynes. </p>
	<p> Let's now add interest. If we say that savings and investment depend on the rate of interest, we have \( S(Y,r) = I(r) + (G-T) \) and \( M = L(Y,r) \) for the money market. This allows output and the interest rate to be determined by fiscal policy \( (G-T) \) and monetary policy \( M \). This is "Mr Keynes and the Classics" by Hicks. </p>
	<p> We can include prices into our theory, by adding an aggregate supply equation \( P = f(Y) \). This means that the question of policy choice depends on the consumption function \( C(Y,r)= Y - S(Y,r) \), the investment function \( I(r) \), the money demand function \( L(Y,r) \) and the aggregate supply equation \( P = f(Y) \). This is the neoclassical synthesis of Patinkin's <i> Money, interest and Prices </i>. </p>
	<p> Another way of looking at output fluctuations is from the equation of exchange \( MV=PY \). It says that the volume of monetary transactions equals the volume of nominal spending. If there are fluctuations in money demand, \( V \) will vary. These fluctuations will lead to fluctuations in \( PY \), which affects real income based on the aggregate supply equation \( P=f(Y) \). The way to stabilise for \( Y^*\) given it is a monetary problem is to use a monetary solution of adjusting \( M \). This is the monetarism of Friedman and Schwartz's <i> A Monetary History<i/>. </p>
	<p> The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on whether it affects the price level or output - and that depends on whether monetary injections are anticipated or not, permanent or not. This means we need to add expectations as \( MV(Y^e,r)=PY \) and \( P=f(Y,P^e) \). Thus money is the short-run adjustment process, while price expectations adjust in the long run. It means that \( Y=Y^* \) when \( P=P^e \). This is the New Classical macroeconomics of "Expectations and the Neutrality of Money" by Lucas. </p>
	<p> The other determinant of output is the capital stock and level of total factor productivity, such that \( Y = A F(k) \). As such, fluctuations in \( Y \) and \( Y^* \) occur due to uneven spurts and jumps in technology. This is the real business cycle of Kydland and Prescott's "Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuation". </p>
	<p> We can combine the insights from the Keynesian neoclassical synthesis, monetarism, the New Classicals and the RBC theorists to produce the new neoclassical synthesis of Woodford's <i> Interest and Prices </i>. This has a consumption-savings-investment-deficit block, a monetary rule block and an aggregate supply block. \[ Y = f(r,Y^e,G-T) \] \[ r = g(P, P^e, Y-Y^*) \] \[ P = h(P^e, Y-Y^*) \] We have output as well as full-employment output fluctuating. We primarily use monetary policy to close the output gap, and we use policy rules because expectations matter. </p>
