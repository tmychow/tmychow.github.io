	<a name="macro"><p><strong>Macroeconomics - The Timeframes</strong></p></a>
	<p> In the ultra short run of the few months, the main adjustment mechanism is inventories. Prices and capital are fixed. In the short run of up to a few years, the main adjustment mechanism is prices. Capital remains quasi-fixed. In the medium run of around a decade, the main adjustment mechanism is capital. Firms enter and exit at this scale. In the long run, everything has adjusted. There are low-frequency fluctuations due to population growth and technological advances. </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Long-Run Growth</strong></p>
	<p> Economic growth in the long run comes from increase total factor productivity - that is, improvements in technology and resource utilisation. That means a useful long-run strategy is to find more cost-effective methods of production and introduce new goods. This is Easterly and Levine 2000, "It's Not Factor Accumulation" or Jones 1995, "Growth: With or Without Scale Effects?". </p>
	<p> Nonetheless, the basic Solow model where factor accumulation occurs can be a useful core of growth theory. That means a useful medium-run strategy is to increase your capital stock, educate your workforce, urbanise and open up to international trade. This is Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992, "A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth". </p>
	<p> Conditional convergence is the dominant paradigm, although convergence itself isn't. This is Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991, "Convergence" or Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991, "Convergence across States and Regions". </p>


	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Medium-Run Money and Prices </strong></p>
	<p> In the long run, the price level is proportional to the level of the money stock and the inflation rate is proportional to the growth rate of the money stock. This is the quantity theory of money. In the long run, the level and growth rate of output is independent of the money stock and its growth rate. This is the neutrality of money - that is, you cannot print yourself rich. These are Hume 1752, "Of Money" or Lucas 1995, "Monetary Neutrality" or McCandless and Weber 1995 "Some Monetary Facts". </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Short-Run Business Cycles</strong></p>
	<p> In the short run, fluctuations in aggregate demand lead to fluctuations in real GDP and in inflation, due to various market frictions, rigidities and imperfections. We would like to minimise these fluctuations. </p>
	<p> Inflation is a monetary phenomenon, so monetary policy can aim at keeping inflation low and stable. Monetary policy can affect output growth and inflation in the short run via the Phillips Curve relationship. This is Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 1999, "Monetary Policy Shocks". Hence stabilisation policy can usefully mitigate business cycle fluctuations. This is Friedman 1968, "The Role of Monetary Policy" or Eichenbaum 1998, "Some Thoughts on Practical Stabilization Policy" or Svensson 2008, "What have we learned in the past 50 years". </p>
	<p> Monetary policy faces a time lag in affecting macroeconomic aggregates, so central banks should target forecasted future aggregate demand by "leaning against the wind". This is Svensson 1997, "Inflation Forecast Targeting". Dealing with aggregate supply shocks is more difficult than dealing with aggregate demand shocks, because they push inflation and real GDP growth in different directions. Dealing with credit or financial shocks is difficult, because they disrupt the mechanism of monetary policy. </p>
	<p> Monetary policy should be based on systematic and predictable rules, rather than discretionary choices. This is Kydland and Prescott 1977, "Rules rather than Discretion". Macroeconomic policy is affected by expectations, and so statistical correlations may break down if policymakers try to exploit them. This is Lucas 1972, "Expectations and the Neutrality of Money" or Lucas 1976, "Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique". </p>
	<p> If monetary policy is stabilising the business cycle, there is little role for countercyclical fiscal policy. This is Auerbach 2002, "Is there a role for discretionary fiscal policy" or Taylor 2000, "Reassessing Discretionary Fiscal Policy". Fiscal policy should focus on microeconomic issues, such as public goods provision, social insurance provision, reasonably non-distortive taxation, and sensible regulation practices. In other words, government should be an insurance company with an army. If monetary policy is unwilling or unable to do so, activist fiscal policy may be required to rectify fluctuations in aggregate demand. We know that monetary expansion is expansionary and fiscal contraction is contractionary. </p>
	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - International Trade and Finance</strong></p>
	<p> In the long run, exchange rates reflect purchasing power parity. This is Rogoff 1996, "The PPP Puzzle". </p>

	<a name="macromodels"><p><strong>Macroeconomics - Basic IS-LM Modelling</strong></p></a>
	<p> Let's begin with the the specifications of our macroeconomic model. We have output \( y \), price level \( p \), interest rate \( r \), fiscal variable \( g \), monetary variable \( m \), and nominal wage \( w \). The Investment-Savings curve \( y = g - br \) describes the goods market - it shows combinations of interest rates associated with output. The Liquidity Preference-Money Supply curve \( m - p = y - hr \) describes the money market - it shows the combinations of interest rates and real income for which money supply equals money demand. Together, they describe the equilibrium level of \( (y,r) \) given some policy variables \( (g,m) \) and price level \( p \). </p>
	<p> We can move to a system that solves for \( (y,p) \) endogenously. We can combine IS-LM into a single equation to eliminate the interest rate. \[ y = \frac{h}{b+h}g + \frac{b}{b+h} (m-p) \] This is a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve in \( (y,p) \) space, with the slope \( -\frac{b}{b+h} \) and is shifted right by monetary and fiscal policy. </p>
	<p> One modern approach has been to look at the IS-MP model instead of IS-LM. This looks at monetary policy in its modern form, with interest rates at the forefront - it takes the form \( r = \frac{1}{h} (p+y-m) \). But the equation is the same as before, simply configured differently - and so this is a pedagogical rather than substantive distinction. </p>
	<p> We can add an aggregate supply curve, with its slope describing how a change in AD is split among price and output and its intercept being affected by the rigid nominal wage. \[ p = w + ay \] This combination allows us to have a system of equations to understand how changes in policy variables \( (g,m,w) \) affect endogenous variables \( (y,p,r) \). </p>

	<p><strong>Macroeconomics - Diagrammatic IS-LM Modelling</strong></p>
	<p> We can derive the AD and SRAS curves graphically. Take an IS-LM diagram. Keep nominal money constant while increasing the price level. This shifts the LM curve upwards, meaning that a higher price level leads to a lower output. Thus we have the AD curve. Now take the labour market. Keep nominal wages constant while increasing the price level. This increases hours worked. We can see that more hours worked increases output in the production function diagram. We can combine this to produce the SRAS. </p>
