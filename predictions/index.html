	<h1>My Predictions</h1>
  	<p>This is just a compilation of the predictions I have made and when I made them. I'll try and add to the list throughout the year and review periodically. This was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow/status/1345509880438861831?s=20">my tweet about COVID-19 predictions</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>List of Predictions</strong></p>
