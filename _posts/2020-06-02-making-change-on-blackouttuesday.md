As \#blackouttuesday has become a widespread phenomenon across Instagram, it is worth considering things we can do beyond simply virtue signalling to make real change.

The first is signing petitions to pressure for change. <br>
\- Charging all 4 officers with murder - [tinyurl.com/yc7nthfp](tinyurl.com/yc7nthfp) <br>
\- If you're based outside the United States, you can use the American post codes of: 90015 (Los Angeles, California), 10001 (New York City, New York), or 75001 (Dallas, Texas). <br>
\- More available at [bit.ly/BlackLivesAction](bit.ly/BlackLivesAction)

The second is donating to support important groups. <br>
\- To George Floyd's family - [tinyurl.com/ydy97ksz](tinyurl.com/ydy97ksz) <br>
\- To Black Lives Matter - [tinyurl.com/ycjb3yzw](tinyurl.com/ycjb3yzw) <br>
\- To Community Bail Funds - [tinyurl.com/ydbvgutu](tinyurl.com/ydbvgutu) <br>
\- If you do not have money to donate, streaming this youtube video will generate advertising revenue, 100% of which will go to family funerals, bail funds and advocacy groups.

The third is to educate yourself and learn about structural racism in your community. <br>
\- Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge <br>
\- Me and White Supremacy by Layla F Saad <br>
\- Read these books and more to better understand racial discrimination. Reflect about how it manifests in your own country and your own community.

George Floyd is simply the most recent name in a long list of names. The systems of oppression, discrimination and exclusion responsible will not just disppear - if we want change, we need to go beyond optical allyship and be actively anti-racist. These are three simple steps to do so - and there's plenty more you can find [online](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/).
