This is the story of why this blog came to be - although it's dated to Feburary 14th, I actually wrote this on December 31st 2020 as a reflection on the year.

I've backdated it for two reasons. One is because I have now written enough that this post will buried under the many others that exist - hence why there are deliberately no tags on this. The other relates to the reason I started this blog.
