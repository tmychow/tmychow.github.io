Yesterday was supposed to be a gripping and transformational moment for American governance, because the Democrats had regained the trifecta of the House, the Senate and the Presidency for the first time in a decade. Yesterday was supposed to be a gripping and transformational moment for American governance, because Senator-elect Raphael Warnock would be the first African-American Democrat from the South to serve in the Senate. Yesterday was supposed to be a gripping and transformational moment for American governance, because Senator-elect Jon Ossoff would be the first Jewish senator from the Deep South since Benjamin Jonas was elected in 1879.

Instead, it was gripping and transformational for all the wrong reasons: for the fact that 8 Republican Senators and the 139 Republican Congresspeople objected to the election results by peddling and humouring unfounded lies around electoral fraud; for the flying of a foreign flag in and around the Capitol bulding; and most importantly, for the attempt of a sitting President to incite a violent incursion of the Houses of Congress as to impede the peaceful transfer of power.

There are a lot of meta-narratives this ties into. 

The most obvious is the incredible levels of racial privilege that exist. In the past, Capitol Police and the National Guard have been deployed for far less, whether that is for clearing out peaceful crowds outside the Capitol or to ensure the President could have a photo op. And they did so with full force, armed with riot gear and tear gas, beating and physically restraining protestors. By contrast, the Capitol Police put up little to no resistance yesterday and could be characterised as practically amicable, [opening the gates](https://twitter.com/cevansavenger/status/1346920924310867968) for the rioters and [taking selfies](https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1346920198461419520) with them - and although not every officer did that, it is shocking that a [lone Black officer](https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1346911809274478594) was left to hold off an entire mob. It is also horrifying that the Department of Defense initially [denied a request for the DC National Guard](https://twitter.com/byaaroncdavis/status/1346908166030766080), before [further dithering due to the optics](https://twitter.com/reporterjoe/status/1346913304221016065). What makes this particularly laughable is that not only was the response yesterday much milder, it should have been much stronger - there's a world of difference between protests at large and what happened yesterday, and if there was a time for lethal force to be used, it's when terrorists attempt to breach into the sanctum of American government. So this is a testament to the level of racial disparity that continues to exist that these attackers were treated so peacefully.

The second pertinent piece of context is regarding the right's hypocrisy - they have long portrayed themselves as believing in law and order, backing "the boys in blue" and being patriotic. It is clear after yesterday that this is just absurd. No principled conservative would ever believe that the appropriate action is to strike at the heart of the democratic process because they didn't get the results they wanted. And yet, that was exactly what the mob did yesterday, because every single one of them was happy to drop their principles as soon as it became convenient. The result was that America, even if just for a short while, became a banana republic where elected officials could not discharge their duties due to the threat of violence, and where they had to be evacuated or [barricaded into a room for their own safety](https://twitter.com/ragipsoylu/status/1346907414919061509).

But crucially, this isn't some short-term or transitory phenomena - this reflects a third broader trend that has been occurring for a while: Republican officials and politicians cynically advancing their careers by pandering and lying to the crowd ad nauseum, whether this is Senator Josh Hawley [greeting the rioters](https://twitter.com/ManuelQ/status/1346913744736157714) or Rudy Giuliani [calling for trial by combat](https://twitter.com/politico/status/1347228936896450561) hours before the insurrection. By refusing to take on the mantle of leadership that requires telling the electorate the uncomfortable truth and instead resorting to conspiracy theories, they have created a substantial proportion of the population that just accepts what the President says to be the divine truth. And that means what happened yesterday, the four people who died at the Capitol, their blood is on the hands of the Republican Party.

And finally, there's just a question of practicalities. Suppose I were an outgoing President wanting not to get prosecuted for my crimes and wanting to stay in power via an autogolpe. What would I do? I would engage in legal gish gallop by filing absurd petitions in courts around the country to challenge the legitimacy of the election. I would use what leverage I had remaining over my party to get them to reiterate this message. And if the electoral votes were still being counted, I would get a large crowd of my supporters riled up and believing in the idea that there was an establishment conspiracy against the people. Then I would set them on Congress, by holding a rally nearby when every member of government has to be attending. I would ensure that Capitol Police were unprepared at best and accomplices at worst to these rioters I've incited and I would attempt to exert pressure on the DoD to delay any deployment of the National Guard. Indeed, if I got lucky and if staffers hadn't [remembered to grab the boxes](https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1346955728834191360), my supporters might have even been able to destroy the votes. I'm not saying there was this massive conspiracy - but given the usual level of preparedness against protestors and given there were explosive devices found at the DNC, RNC and in the Capitol, it does strike me as complete incompetence if I am being generous, and something more nefarious if I am not.

So what comes next, when nearly half of the Republican Party genuinely believes that the election was a sham? I don't know - but I think the overarching lesson here, which many like Sarah Kendzior have trumpeted for a while, is the same message as presented in the 9/11 Commission's [executive summary of its report](https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Exec.htm): "the most important failure was one of imagination". People have systematically failed to take the President as his word when he says he wants to sow discord or undermine democracy, or obstruct the electoral process. 

Let me conclude by explaining where the title of this post comes from. It's an allusion to an episode of the Newsroom called "The 112th Congress", updated to the current Congressional session that started on January 3rd 2021.

"I understood the Tea Party in the beginning, just like I understood the SDS. The Tea Party was a middle class movement responding spontaneously to bad trends: wages were stagnant, jobs were disappearing, Wall Street got trillions and everybody was laughing at them. They've been co-opted by the radical right, which in turn has enslaved the Republican middle. ... The Tea Party is being radicalised and their original organising principles obliterated, and no one should be laughing anymore - they should be scared shitless. My party is being hijacked and it's happening in real time. How is this not our top story every night?" <br>
- Will McAvoy in "The 112th Congress" (The Newsroom)

Today, this quote rings just as relevant, if not more so, as when it was first said. What we saw saw and what I live-tweeted the attempted coup of American government, a direct consequence of Republican behaviour. If it wasn't already the most important narrative in your mind, it damn well should be now.
