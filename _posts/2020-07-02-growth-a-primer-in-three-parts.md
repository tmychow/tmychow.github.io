In these turbulent and uncertain times, it is easy to focus only on the violent economic fluctuations within the business cycle. But there is also a bigger picture - the longer-run increase in economic output across history. Measuring growth is important, because it defines the standard of living available to humanity.

**What is the history of economic growth?**

[Clark 2007](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8461.pdf) gives a three part account of the history of economic growth.

Firstly, a Malthusian trap persisted till 1800. That is, income per person varied across societies and epochs without an upward trend. Short-term gains in income from technological advances were lost to population growth. In fact, material living standards declined from the Stone Age to the 1800s, because life expectancy stayed static at 30 to 35 years, while society became less egalitarian.

Secondly, the Industrial Revolution changed the possibilities for material consumption. There was a large increase in output per person for a select group of countries, with the richest modern economies being ten to twenty times wealthier than in 1800.

Thirdly, prosperity has not arrived to all societies. Some countries have since converged to those modern economies, while others remain well below pre-industrial norms. This is most pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa. This Great Divergence is so massive that the gap in incomes between countries is on the order of 50 to 1.

In [Part I]({% post_url 2020-07-10-a-primer-on-economic-growth-part-I %}), we will look at some basic theoretical models that describe economic growth.

In [Part II]({% post_url 2020-07-24-a-primer-on-economic-growth-part-II %}), we will look at the 'big history' reasons as to why countries are able to grow their factors of production and improve their productivity - that is, the fundamental rather than proximate explanation for growth.

Finally, we will return to these big questions in Part III, applying the framework we will have established to explain the Industrial Revolution and why it occurred in England.
