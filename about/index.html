	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p><strong>My Personal Background</strong></p>
	<p>Hey there! I'm Trevor Chow and I am an 18-year old from Hong Kong who studies in the UK. I am primarily interested in monetary policy, housing policy and computational statistics. This website is a collection of my ramblings on economics and public policy. I post around once a fortnight - feel free to message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow">twitter</a> if you have any thoughts. I also co-run an <a href="https://instagram.com/foreverfeminism/">instagram</a> and a <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCGsJjOYlJIy0K5Cg3D3f3bA">youtube</a> account, both of which bring attention to important social issues across the globe.</p>
	<p>Some of my current content includes discussing economics, coronavirus, and other miscellaneous topics relating to politics, law and social movements. This content is broadly arranged into three types - shorter back-of-the-envelope takes, longer researched effortposts and interviews.</p>
	<p><strong>Where do I stand?</strong></p>
	<p>My policy positions can be summarised as "neoliberal" in a very online, reddit-centric sense. In short, I believe in evidence-based pragmatism and a general deference towards individual liberty and personal choice. A longer list of where I stand on specific issues and why I believe those things will soon be available on the Useful Files page.</p>
