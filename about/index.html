	<p><strong>The Structure of this Blog</strong></p>
	<p> My blog content is broadly arranged into four types - takes, effortposts, interviews and notes. Takes are short back-of-the-envelope thoughts I have that aren't terribly rigorous. Effortposts are pieces where I put a decent amount of time into research - however, they are by no means perfectly balanced literature reviews, so do message me if you see anything amiss. Interviews are transcripts of my conversations with people about economics or policy. Notes is a collection of things I've jotted down in the course of my reading. I have also uploaded some PDFs I've made which may be of use to others, available <a href="/usefulfiles">here</a> - and I have a list of my predictions <a href="/predictions">here</a>.</p>

	<p> There are innumerable people who have influenced how I think about economics - here are the 5 that were perhaps the most impactful and who I admire the most. Paul Krugman for what he has termed "the MIT style: small models applied to real problems, blending real-world observation and a little mathematics to cut through to the core of an issue". Emi Nakamura for her incredible work in macroeconomic identification and usage of microdata to examine price-setting. Nick Rowe for his lucidity and clarity in explaining the role of money in business cycles. Claudia Sahm for her relentless drive to make the field of economics accessible to all and to help people in need by listening to them. Scott Sumner for market monetarism and his vigilance in not reasoning from price changes. </p>
