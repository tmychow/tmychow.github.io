	<p><strong>The Structure of this Blog</strong></p>
	<p> As a first year undergraduate, I have unsurprisingly not-entirely-formed views. As such, my blog content is broadly arranged into four types to reflect differing levels of epistemic confidence: takes, effortposts, interviews and notes. Takes are short back-of-the-envelope thoughts I have that aren't terribly rigorous. Effortposts are pieces where I put a decent amount of time into research - however, they are by no means perfectly balanced literature reviews, so do message me if you see anything amiss. Interviews are transcripts of my conversations with people about economics or policy. Notes is a collection of things I've jotted down in the course of my reading. I have also uploaded some PDFs I've made which may be of use to others, available <a href="/usefulfiles">here</a>.</p>

	<p> There are innumerable people who have influenced how I think about economics - here are a few who were perhaps the most impactful and who I admire the most. Ideologically, Miles Kimball, Scott Sumner and Nick Rowe have all made me deeply monetarist, with a blend of neomonetarist and market monetarist flavours. Methodologically, Paul Krugman and Emi Nakamura exemplify two different but compelling approaches: the former for what he has termed "the MIT style: small models applied to real problems, blending real-world observation and a little mathematics to cut through to the core of an issue"; the latter for her use of all sorts of data (microdata, high frequency data etc.) in macroeconomic identification. Practically, Ben Bernanke and Claudia Sahm have demonstrated how important it is to listen to people and to apply economics in ways that are of use. </p>
