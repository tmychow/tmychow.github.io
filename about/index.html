	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p><strong>My Personal Background</strong></p>
	<p>Hey there! I'm Trevor and I'm a first year economist and Jardine Scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge. Previously, I was a King's Scholar at Eton College. This website is a collection of my ramblings on economics and various other things, with a focus on macroeconomics. I post around once a fortnight and you can keep up with my posts by <a href="https://buttondown.email/tmychow">subscribing to my newsletter</a> - feel free to message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow">twitter</a> or to <a href="mailto:tmychow@gmail.com?subject=Mostly Economic Musings">email me</a> if you have any thoughts. I'm always open to opportunities to get involved in policy thinktanks, economic research and policymaking - my resume is readily available <a href="/assets/Resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	<p> My blog content is broadly arranged into four types - takes, effortposts, interviews and notes. Takes are short back-of-the-envelope thoughts I have that aren't terribly rigorous. Effortposts are pieces where I put a decent amount of time into research - however, they are by no means perfectly balanced literature reviews, so do message me if you see anything amiss. Interviews are transcripts of my conversations with people about economics or policy. Notes is a collection of things I've jotted down in the course of my reading. </p>
