title: Trevor's Mostly Economic Musings
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <h4>My Personal Background</h4>
	<p>I'm Trevor and I am a 18-year old student who is interested in public policy, with a specific focus on economics. I am primarily interested in monetary policy, housing policy and computational statistics. I also co-run an instagram account that brings attention to feminist and queer issues across the globe.</p>
  <p>As such, my posts mostly focus on economic analysis, with a dose of political commentary for when I discuss more peripheral claims.</p>
  <h4>Where do I stand?</h4>
  <p>My policy positions can be summarised as "neoliberal" in a very online, reddit-centric sense. In short, I believe in evidence-based pragmatism and a general deference towards individual liberty and personal choice. A longer list of where I stand on specific issues and why I believe those things will soon be available on the Useful Files page.</p>
