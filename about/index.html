	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p><strong>My Personal Background</strong></p>
	<p>Hey there! I'm Trevor Chow and I am an 18-year old from Hong Kong who studies in the UK. This website is a collection of my ramblings on economics and public policy. I post around once a fortnight - feel free to message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow">twitter</a> if you have any thoughts. I also co-run an <a href="https://instagram.com/foreverfeminism/">instagram</a> and a <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCGsJjOYlJIy0K5Cg3D3f3bA">youtube</a> account, both of which bring attention to important social issues across the globe.</p>
	<p> My content is broadly arranged into four types - takes, effortposts, interviews and notes. Takes are short back-of-the-envelope thoughts I have that aren't terribly rigorous. Effortposts are pieces where I put a decent amount of time into research. Interviews are transcripts of my conversations with academics and policy people. Notes is a collection of things I've jotted down in the course of my reading. </p>
	<p><strong>Where do I stand?</strong></p>
	<p>My view on publi policy can be summarised as "neoliberal" and epistemically modest. It is a framework with a great deal of deference towards individual liberty, coupled with a healthy dose of evidence-based pragmatism. </p>
