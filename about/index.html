	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p><strong>My Personal Background</strong></p>
	<p>Hey there! I'm Trevor Chow and I am a 18-year old student. I am primarily interested in monetary policy, housing policy and computational statistics. This website is a collection of my ramblings on economics and public policy. I post around once a fortnight - feel free to message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow">twitter</a> if you have any thoughts. I also co-run an <a href="https://instagram.com/foreverfeminism/">instagram</a> and a <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCGsJjOYlJIy0K5Cg3D3f3bA">youtube</a> account, both of which bring attention to important social issues across the globe.</p>
	<p>Some of my current content includes conducting <a href="/tag/interview">interviews</a>, as well as discussing <a href="/tag/economics">economics</a>, <a href="/tag/coronavirus">coronavirus</a>, and other <a href="/tag/miscellaneous">miscellaneous</a> topics.</p>
	<p><b>Where do I stand?</b></p>
	<p>My policy positions can be summarised as "neoliberal" in a very online, reddit-centric sense. In short, I believe in evidence-based pragmatism and a general deference towards individual liberty and personal choice. A longer list of where I stand on specific issues and why I believe those things will soon be available on the Useful Files page.</p>
	<h4>Sequences</h4>
	<p>There are a whole series of things I have and I'd like to learn about. I'm going to be outlining them in 'sequences', which are simply lists of resources I've used or plan on using. They will be ordered in such a way that other people could go through them and it would make sense. </p>
