	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p><strong>My Personal Background</strong></p>
	<p>Hey there! I'm Trevor and I'm a student from Hong Kong who is reading Economics at Cambridge. This website is a collection of my ramblings on economics and public policy. I post around once a fortnight - feel free to message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow">twitter</a> or to <a href = "mailto:tmychow@.com?subject = Mostly Economic Musings">email me</a> if you have any thoughts. I also co-run an <a href="https://instagram.com/foreverfeminism/">instagram</a> account, which focuses on important social issues across the globe.</p>
	<p> My content is broadly arranged into four types - takes, effortposts, interviews and notes. Takes are short back-of-the-envelope thoughts I have that aren't terribly rigorous. Effortposts are pieces where I put a decent amount of time into research - however, they are by no means perfectly balanced literature reviews of the subject matter so do message me if you see anything amiss. Interviews are transcripts of my conversations with people about economics or policy. Notes is a collection of things I've jotted down in the course of my reading. </p>
